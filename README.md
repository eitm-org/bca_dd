To produce analysis report:

1) pull repo
2) add a .Rproj to the directory for the repo
3) open the .Rproj
4) it should prompt you to install all the necessary packages, but if it doesn't do that on your own
5) run the R/data_cleaning.R script (if using Source doesn't work, you might have to run it line by line)
